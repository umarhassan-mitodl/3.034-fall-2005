Laboratory Grading
------------------

As will be discussed at the first recitation, each laboratory includes a short quiz at the start of the session, and an independent written assignment. Prof. Van Vliet grades all quizzes and laboratory assignments, and will handle excused / unexcused absences related to the laboratory experiments. Late arrivals and unexcused absences receive a zero for that laboratory experiment.
